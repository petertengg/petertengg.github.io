## Welcome

{:.text-justify}
I decided to start a blog because I enjoy writing texts for humans just as much as for machines. Some humans even say that my writings are enganging and enjoyable to read. I didn't get such positive feedback from a machine (C++ compilers have poor humor) until recently, when AI has become a thing. Now even AI can appreciate my writings (at least seamingly), and I can appreciate their help too. However I don't exploit their help beyond fixing grammar issues and typos in my writings, because I think AI is a tool that should be used for boring tasks, not the creative and fun ones. Since I enjoy writing, I keep that part for myself.

{:.text-justify}
Another reason for me to write this blog is I always keep learning and discovering new things and I like to take notes for myself, so I can remember later. A blog is a form of taking notes, and making them available for others too. I feel like an ever-beginner, constanly struggling with obstacles, which is frustrating, but then having the rewarding a-ha moment, when you find the solution. That's the most fun and motivating part that pushes me out of my comfort zone to take the pain of learning curves again and again. This is why I never forget what it is like to be a beginner, and I can deliver my experiences in a beginner friendly way.

{:.text-justify}
Lastly, I have learned that I can become very enthusiastic about something, but then my interest fades, or other duties or interests take my time and energy. In the beginning I felt it was a bad thing, but then I realised it is natural, and I can just live with it. This applies the blogging itself too. I don't want to force myself into a very demanding regular publication schedule on this site. I will rather publish when I feel it natural. The blog is a side project, a journal of my other, more important projects afterall.

{:.text-justify}
This site is a mixture of professional and personal topics. Instead of maintaining separate blogs, I collect everything here and organise it into sub-blogs. 
You can find a bit more information about each topic.

## Sub-blogs

### [Bugs in the Soup](/bugs-in-the-soup/) - Programming

{:.text-justify}
I used to have a standalone blog with the same name before on a paid domain. I started it with big enthusiasm, but then my activity dropped. It was a fun project however, and I was happy with its content. I have now discovered Jekyll and Github Pages, and I feel like they are the perfect place to revive my blog. My posts often revolve around the aforementioned obstable-struggle-solution cycle.

### [Optimal Banana](/cooking/) - Cooking

#### Why *"Optimal Banana"*? 

{:.text-justify}
I used to post about cooking and food on 
<i class="fab fa-instagram"></i>
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/minimal_onion/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, as <span class="text-highlight">minimal_onion</span> but that name was a bit misleading for someone who loves onions and garlic, so I am rebranding. *Optimal* sounds more related to engineering as well. Cooking and engineering are not so far apart after all. :)

{:.text-justify}
Here I will share some of my experiments, successes and learning points in the kitchen. It also helps me to remember what I have made and what to improve next time.

#### Why "*Hogwash*"?

{:.text-justify}
At the end of each cooking post you will see a section titled <span class="text-highlight">Hogwash</span>. The obvious explanation would be, because that's where the remainders after a meal end up. Well, I don't throw any food, so that's not the case here. Have you ever tried searching a recipe for that delicious Pecan Breaded Chicken Breast that you tried last week at the restaurant? And when you click it, you are directed to a blogpost, where a wall of texts awaits you. You don't even see the ingredient list. You have to scroll down 3 pages to find the "bread and butter" of the post. The recipe is carefully hidden in a huge wall of BS, that no-one cares about. Well, *Hogwash* is a synonym for *BS* and I decided to put my *Hogwash* at the end, so you can jump on the cooking right away, and if you really want to read my charming story about the recipe, you can to it at the end. It is optional, it is optimal. :)
