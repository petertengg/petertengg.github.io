## Introduction

Predicting Bitcoin's price for the cycle top is a fool's game, and any prudent person with some self-respect should stay away from it. 

In my view, it is like playing the lottery. I have a very high chance of not winning anything, and only a negligible chance of hitting the jackpot. If I don't guess the top, I will be just one of the {% include link.html key="youtube_1000_more_fools" text="thousand fools being born every freakin' day" %}. But if I nail it, that is a pretty nice achievement that I can brag about, so I will give it a shot.

At the end of the post, you will find my price predictions, but be prepared for some math {% include link.html key="youtube_along_the_way" text="along the way" %}. (Any Bad Religion fans here?). Feel free to jump ahead to the final numbers, but I won't give you a jump link here, so at least you have to work a little bit for it. ;)

## My prediction model

Since I wrote a deep dive about the {% include link.html key="trading_puell_multiple" text="Puell Multiple" %} in my previous post, I use it as a basis for my calculations. 

### Step 1: Predicting the Puell Multiple

In my previous post, I {% include link.html key="trading_puell_multiple" text="introduced" anchor="#puell-multiple-halving-corrected" %} a corrected version of the Puell Multiple, which allows one to assign an overvalued threshold of `12.49` to the indicator. If you are not familiar with how it works feel free to check out its details {% include link.html key="trading_puell_multiple" text="here" anchor="#puell-multiple-halving-corrected" %}.

Looking at the historical behaviour of the `Halving-Corrected Puell Multiple`, I came up with these three cases:
- *Conservative case*: `10.4`: this was the value at peak (5), when there was a cycle top, but the indicator didn't reach the overvalued territory
- *Base case*: `12.5`: just a bit above the overvalued line
- *Bull case*: `13.61`: the value at peak (3) from December 2013, when the indicator shot over the threshold by a good margin. It hasn't been there since, and it is unlikely to revisit that value.

The current correction factor, after the 4th halving is $1,63^4 = 7.059$. Dividing the above three cases by `7.059`, I transformed them back to the original Puell Multiple's scale:
- *Conservative case*: `1.4733`
- *Base case*: `1.7708`
- *Bull case*: `1.9252`

### Step 2: Calculating the Miner Revenue from the Puell Multiple

The Puell Multiple is a ratio between the `Current Miner Revenue` and the `365-Day Moving Average of the Miner Revenue`. We know the ratio. In order to calculate either term of the ratio, we have to know the other one. Here, it is easier to predict the `Moving Average`, as its movement is much smoother and more predictable than the erratic raw `Miner Revenue`. 

The `365-day Moving Average of the Mining Revenue ` is at `44.752M` USD on the monthly chart at the time of writing. We can expect that it will go higher as the `Miner Revenue` goes higher while we are approaching the cycle top, so even the conservative case should be higher than the current value. My `Miner Revenue MA` estimates based on this, are:
- *Conservative case*: `46.8M`
- *Base case*: `50M`
- *Bull case*: `52M`
 
Multiplying the `Miner Revenue MA` values by the previously estimated `Puell Multiples` gives us nine (three times three) possible `Miner Revenue` values at the cycle tops. I leave the arithmetic to the reader.

### Step 3: Calculating Bitcoin's price from Miner Revenue

Miners get their rewards in Bitcoin for their effort to secure the network. Since we have `Miner Revenue` estimations from the previous step in USD, we need to know (estimate) how many Bitcoin is issued daily, then it becomes a simple divison:

{% raw %}
$$
\text{Bitcoin price} = 
\frac{
  \text{Miner revenue}
}{
  \text{Bitcoin's daily issuance}
}
$$
{% endraw %}

Luckily, this data is available on {% include link.html key="macromicro_btc_issuance" text="MacroMicro" %} for free.

{% include image.html src="/assets/images/trading/bitcoin-price-prediction/btc-price-pred-1.png"
   alt="Figure 1: Bitcoin Issuance by Day (source: MacroMicro)"
   id="fig-btc-price-pred-1" %}


In `Figure 1`, you can see the daily Bitcoin issuance for the past year. As discussed {% include link.html key="trading_puell_multiple" text="in my previous post" anchor="#puell-multiple-indicator" newtab="true" %}, the Miner Revenue (and thus the Bitcoin issuance) consists of two parts:
1. *The block reward*: it is fixed and doesn't change between halvings
2. *Transaction fees*: depends on the network traffic

As you can see, Bitcoin issuance changes from day to day, and in the past one year we can see that
1. The highest value it hit was 575 Bitcoin (BTC) ([(1) in Figure 1](#fig-btc-price-pred-1))
2. `560` BTC was a well respected level, touched only 3 times [(2)](#fig-btc-price-pred-1)
3. We can consider `520` BTC relatively high, with most of the days being below it [(3)](#fig-btc-price-pred-1)
4. The average falls between `480` and `440` a day, so we can say that `480` is above average [(4)](#fig-btc-price-pred-1)

When Bitcoin's price hits All-Time Highs (ATH), we can expect more attention from traders and investors, which translates to more transactions on the network, therefore I expect above average transaction fees issued. My estimates are:
- *Conservative case*: `480`
- *Base case*: `520`
- *Bull case*: `560`

By dividing our Miner Revenue estimates by these daily issuance values, we will get three estimates for each.

### Step 4: Putting it all together

As we have seen, in Steps [1](#step-1-predicting-the-puell-multiple), [2](#step-2-calculating-the-miner-revenue-from-the-puell-multiple) and [3](#step-3-calculating-bitcoins-price-from-miner-revenue), we have three parameters of the equation that I had to estimate:
1. The Puell Multiple
2. Moving Average of the Miner Revenue
3. Daily Issuance

The equation itself is as follows
{% raw %}
$$
\text{Bitcoin price} = 
\frac{
  \text{Miner Revenue MA} * \text{Puell Multiple}
}{
  \text{Bitcoin's daily issuance}
}
$$
{% endraw %}

I have estimated three cases (conservative, base and bull) for each of these parameters. Calculating all combinations yields 3x3x3 = 27 Bitcoin price estimations. (you can find the results in the [Appendix](#appendix)).

Now you could say that I am cheating, because that is 27 lottery tickets as opposed to one. Okay, let's narrow it down:
- The `minimum` estimated price is `123125.5` USD, which Bitcoin has already surpassed at the time of writing. 
- The `maximum` estimated price is `208563.5` USD
- The `average` of all estimations is `165009` USD

Now I have narrowed it down to three "tickets" (one of which is already out of the game). Are you still not happy? Okay, I will give you my base case, which is the value you get when you take the base cases of each parameter in the calculation: 
- Puell Multiple = `1.7708`
- Miner Revenue MA = `50M USD`
- Bitcoin Daily Issuance = `520`. 

This gives us `170268.2 USD`.

## Conclusion

In this post, I have described my simple mathematical model based on the Puell Multiple to predict Bitcoin's cycle top price. It has three input parameters, that I had to estimate. I estimated a conservative, a base and a bull case for each of these parameters. Calculating all combinations gave me 27 values that I could analyse statistically (min, max, average). I have also provided my base case that is calculated from the base cases of all the parameters.

### My intuition

- Personally, I like the `average` value of the result set, which is `165009 USD`. I feel it realistic than the `base case`:
- The base case of `170268.2 USD`, even though it is calculated from my base case parameters, feels a bit high, but who knows, Bitcoin could surprise us to the upside (writing it on 27th October 2025).

So if I had to pick one simple, marketable number, I would go with `165000` USD for Bitcoin.

Thanks for reading. Let me know in the comments what you think about this estimation, and how it compares to yours!
