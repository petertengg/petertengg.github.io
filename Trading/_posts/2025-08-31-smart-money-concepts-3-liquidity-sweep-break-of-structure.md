## Introduction

### Institutional and retail traders

You may have heard the statistics: in trading 80-85% of the traders lose money in the long run. Trading is a zero sum game, which means that one trader's gain is another trader's loss. So why isn't the ratio 50-50? Half of the traders lose, the other half wins?

The market doesn't consist of homogenous traders. There are bigger and smaller player, but they can classified into to major categories:

1. `Retail traders`:
    - Usually normal people like you and me with limited funds, trying to gain some extra income.
    - Use basic `Technical Analysis (TA)` tools, like indicators, chart patterns, candlestick patterns
    - Impatient, inconsistent, affected by their emotions
    - Can't sleep at night
    - Mostly lose money
    - Also known as "`dumb money`"

2. `Institutions`:
    - Organisations that handle huge amounts of investment capital
    - Have access to a lot more information about the market, including retail positions, openings, SLs
    - Familiar with the `retail` techniques and psychology
    - Patient (they have a lot of time, no rush), calculated moves, no emotions
    - Sleep very well at night
    - Make even more money
    - Also known as "`smart money`"

These two sectors are competing with each other. Or, better put, the institutions hunt the retail. The field is tilted heavily towards the institutions, which is why most retail traders lose. If I have already turned your interest in trading off, that's completely fair, I won't blame you. If you stop reading now, and avoid trading altogether, that's not a bad choice either, you surely won't lose any money. But if you want to know how it is still possible to take advantage of this unfair situation, read on!

## Introduction
- Forex trading is a zero-sum game
- Smart Money Concepts (SMC): the institutional players try to extract money from retail
    - Retail: basic TA (books, YT, indicators (RSI), candlestick patterns)
    - Institutions have a huge advantage: they have more information available about the market than retail investors. Among others: the positions, openings, SLs of the retail.
    - Inistitutions try to hunt down the retail's SLs. For example they push down the price to trigger SLs. This pushes prices even lower letting them to buy cheap. After the SLs have been closed, retail switches side and start shorting too, seeing that the price is falling, pushing it even lower.
    - This is why it is a good idea to learn the retail TA and methods well, and do the opposite. If there are obvious SL levels, it can be a very lucrative shorting position in case of a false breakout
    - This is a little bit of market manipulation. They abuse the inconsistency of the retail sector. 80-85% of them lose money in the long run. The retail only think about price formations (wedges, RSI, etc), but don't think about the reasons behind them. They don't think about big fish hunting for them.
