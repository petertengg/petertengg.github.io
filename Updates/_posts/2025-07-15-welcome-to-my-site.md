## Welcome

I decided to start a blog because I enjoy writing texts for humans just as much as for machines. Some humans even say that my writings are engaging and enjoyable to read. I didn't get such positive feedback from a machine (C++ compilers have poor humor) until recently, when AI has become a thing. Now even AI can appreciate my writings (at least seemingly), and I can appreciate their help too. However, I don't exploit their help beyond fixing grammar issues and typos in my writings, because I think AI is a tool that should be used for boring tasks, not the creative and fun ones. Since I enjoy writing, I keep that part for myself.

Another reason for me to write this blog is I'm always learning and discovering new things, and I like to take notes for future reference. A blog is a form of taking notes, and making them available for others too. I feel like an ever-beginner, constantly struggling with obstacles, but then having the rewarding a-ha moment when I find the solution. That's the most fun and motivating part that pushes me to go through the pain of learning again and again. This is why I never forget what it is like to be a beginner, and I can deliver my experiences in a beginner-friendly way.

This site is a mixture of professional and personal topics. Instead of maintaining separate blogs, I collect everything here and organise it into sub-blogs. 
You can find more information about each topic below.

## Sub-blogs

### [Bugs in the Soup](/programming/) - Programming

I used to have a standalone blog titled `Bugs in the Soup` before on a paid domain. I started it with big enthusiasm, but then my activity dropped. However, it was still a fun project, and I was happy with its content. I have now discovered Jekyll and Github Pages, and I feel like they are the perfect tools to revive my blog. My posts often revolve around the aforementioned obstacle-struggle-solution cycle.

### [Portfolio](/portfolio/)

Here I will present exciting projects that I have built.

### [Updates](/updates/)

Here you will find all the latest published posts mixed together regardless of which topic they belong to, as well as housekeeping posts that only appear here and deliver site related announcements.
