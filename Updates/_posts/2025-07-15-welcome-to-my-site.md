## Welcome

I decided to start a blog because I enjoy writing texts for humans just as much as for machines. Some humans even say that my writings are engaging and enjoyable to read. I didn't get such positive feedback from a machine (C++ compilers have poor humor) until recently, when AI has become a thing. Now even AI can appreciate my writings (at least seemingly), and I can appreciate their help too. However, I don't exploit their help beyond fixing grammar issues and typos in my writings, because I think AI is a tool that should be used for boring tasks, not the creative and fun ones. Since I enjoy writing, I keep that part for myself.

Another reason for me to write this blog is I'm always learning and discovering new things, and I like to take notes for future reference. A blog is a form of taking notes, and making them available for others too. I feel like an ever-beginner, constantly struggling with obstacles, but then having the rewarding a-ha moment when I find the solution. That's the most fun and motivating part that pushes me to go through the pain of learning again and again. This is why I never forget what it is like to be a beginner, and I can deliver my experiences in a beginner-friendly way.

This site is a mixture of professional and personal topics. Instead of maintaining separate blogs, I collect everything here and organise it into sub-blogs. 
You can find more information about each topic below.

## Sub-blogs

### [Bugs in the Soup](/programming/) - Programming

I used to have a standalone blog titled `Bugs in the Soup` before on a paid domain. I started it with big enthusiasm, but then my activity dropped. However, it was still a fun project, and I was happy with its content. I have now discovered Jekyll and Github Pages, and I feel like they are the perfect tools to revive my blog. My posts often revolve around the aforementioned obstacle-struggle-solution cycle.

### <a href="/trading/"><span class="text-highlight">O</span>peration <span class="text-highlight">H</span>ead<span class="text-highlight">L</span>ess <span class="text-highlight">C</span>hicken</a> - Trading

If you get the joke in the title, then you are in the right place, welcome. :) 

If you don't, don't worry, I will bring you up to speed. 

In trading, the most common chart-type to depict the price action of a financial asset over time is the so called candlestick chart. On a candlestick chart, each period (for example a day of trading) is represented by a candle. A candle tells you these four pieces of information about any given day: 
  - The <span class="text-highlight">O</span>pening price
  - The <span class="text-highlight">H</span>ighest price 
  - The <span class="text-highlight">L</span>owest price and 
  - The <span class="text-highlight">C</span>losing price of the day. 
  
  Now, before heading off to conquer the markets and making life changing money, I suggest you equip yourself with a bit more knowledge at [my trading sub-blog](/trading/).
