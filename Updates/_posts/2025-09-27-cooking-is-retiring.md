## The reason

It has been short-lived, but I decided to retire the cooking section on my site. Why? Writing a blog post is time-consuming, especially the technical ones. Even though I love cooking and do it a lot, posting about it would consume valuable time from my main focus areas. 

Recently I have revisited {% include link.html key="medium_warren_buffet" text="Warren Buffet's 5/25 rule" %} and I realised that blogging about cooking falls in the `avoid at all costs` category.

## What comes instead?

From now on, I’ll dedicate my time and energy to the original purpose of this site:
  - Programming
  - Project showcases
  - `Trading`

The only post in the cooking section was an oven roasted chicken recipe. While the recipe is gone, the chicken remains with us in spirit. My new trading-focused sub-blog will have the codename "<span class="text-highlight">O</span>peration <span class="text-highlight">H</span>ead<span class="text-highlight">L</span>ess <span class="text-highlight">C</span>hicken". 

I will kick it off with a series of posts about `Smart Money Concepts (SMC)`. Are you ready to take a deep dive in the fascinating, but often ruthless world of exchange trading?
