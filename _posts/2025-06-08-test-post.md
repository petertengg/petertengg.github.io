# 👋 Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! This is my very first post using **Jekyll** and **GitHub Pages**, and I couldn’t be more excited to start sharing ideas, projects, and learning experiences with the world.

## 🧱 What is This Site?

This site is built using:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) – a simple static site generator for personal blogs and project pages
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) – free hosting for static sites
- A custom domain (coming soon!)

## 💡 What to Expect

On this blog, you can expect posts about:

- 💻 Programming (C++, Python, automation, scripting)
- 📈 Trading tech (Pine Script, MetaTrader, backtesting)
- 🎮 Game development tips & tricks
- 🧠 Personal insights and productivity hacks

## ✨ Why I’m Blogging

I believe writing is a powerful tool to clarify thinking, document progress, and give back to the community. Plus, it’s fun!

If you're reading this, thanks for stopping by. Feel free to explore the rest of the site, and connect with me on GitHub or LinkedIn!
