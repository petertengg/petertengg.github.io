Why Jekyll?
- Github pages: free
- Relatively easy learning curve
- Satisfying results, fun to work with
- Good theme support

- gateway drug to web development

Publish checklist:
- test on desktop dev:
    - if any file name changed: broken links
    - click all new links
- test on mobile (chrome)
- publish
    - check mobile
    - ask others to check
    - publish on less important platforms
    - publish on more importent ones

ChatGPT:
    1. Why I Built My Site

    I wanted a central place to:

        Share my projects (portfolio)

        Blog about programming and personal hobbies

        Build a professional online presence as I transition into freelancing

    I chose Jekyll + GitHub Pages because it's free, version-controlled, and integrates well with my workflow as a developer.

2. What I Used and Learned

    Tools & stack:

        Jekyll with the Minimal Mistakes theme

        GitHub Pages for hosting

        Custom domain from Namecheap

        Ruby, Liquid, Markdown, YAML config

    Key lessons:

        Managing multiple blog sections (like cooking + programming)

        Setting up SEO basics, favicons, and responsive images

        Enabling Disqus comments and working with GitHub’s custom domain setup

3. What’s Next

    I’ll keep improving the site, but my main focus now shifts to:

        Building and documenting trading systems and backtesting tools

        Sharing performance insights from my C++ and Python work

    Stay tuned on petertengg.com — I’ll mix code, cooking, and a few experiments.
