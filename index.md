### About this Site

{:.text-justify}
This site is a mixture of professional and personal topics. Instead of maintaining separate blogs, I collect everything here and organise it into sub-blogs. I hope you will find something that interest you. For now you can explore the following topics:
- Programming – [Bugs in the Soup](/bugs-in-the-soup/)
- Cooking – [Optimal Banana](/optimal-banana/)
- Portfolio – [Things I Have Cooked Up (Not Food!)](/portfolio/)
- Updates – [What’s New](/updates/)

For more details see [Welcome to my Site](/updates/welcome-to-my-site).
